This document describes how event hooks work in the Translate extension;
how to add hooks for an event; and how to run hooks for an event.

For a more comprehensive guide to hooks, navigate to your root MediaWiki
directory, and then find /docs/hooks.txt.

== Rationale ==

Hooks allow us to decouple optionally-run code from code that is run for
everyone. It allows MediaWiki hackers, third-party developers and local
administrators to define code that will be run at certain points in the mainline
code, and to modify the data run by that mainline code. Hooks can keep mainline
code simple, and make it easier to write extensions. Hooks are a principled
alternative to local patches.

== Writing hooks ==
A hook is a chunk of code run at some particular event. It consists of:

  * a function with some optional accompanying data, or
  * an object with a method and some optional accompanying data.

=== PHP hooks ===
PHP hooks are registered by adding them to the global $wgHooks array for a given
event. All the following are valid ways to define hooks:

	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = 'someFunction'; # function, no data
	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = array('someFunction', $someData);
	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = array('someFunction'); # weird, but OK

	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = $object; # object only
	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = array($object, 'someMethod');
	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = array($object, 'someMethod', $someData);
	$wgHooks['EventName'][] = array($object); # weird but OK

Hooks can return three possible values:

  * true: the hook has operated successfully
  * "some string": an error occurred; processing should stop and the error
                   should be shown to the user
  * false: the hook has successfully done the work necessary and the calling
           function should skip

=== JavaScript hooks ===
JavaScript hooks for the Translate extension are a little different; one way to
define them is as follows:

	mw.translate = mw.translate || {}; //Only need to do this once per context
	mw.translate.hooks = mw.translate.hooks || {}; //Only need to do this once per context
	mw.translate.hooks.eventName = mw.translate.hooks.eventName || [];
	mw.translate.hooks.eventName.push( hookFunction );

where hookFunction is not a string (as in the case of PHP hooks) but a function reference.
Hook functions can also return the same values at PHP hooks, although they are at
present ignored.

== Events and parameters ==

This is a list of known events and parameters; please add to it if you're going
to add events to the Translate extension.

=== PHP events ===
'TranslateFormatMessageBeforeTable': Provides an opportunity to manipulate the display of translation strings (messages) in the main table
	&$message: The message that will be displayed
	$translation: The current translation (or null if not yet translated)
	$original: The original (untranslated) message
	&$attributes: An array of attributes that will

'TranslateGetExtraInputs': Provides an opportunity to add extra form inputs to to the default translation editor
	&$translation: The translation string as it stands
	&$extraInputs: The extra input space, ready for HTML to be appended

'TranslatePrefillTranslation': Provides an opportunity for a new translation to start not from as a carte blanche (the default) but from some prefilled string
	&$translation: The translation string as it stands
	$handle: The current MessageHandle object

=== JavaScript events ===
mw.translate.hooks.afterSubmit: Provides an opportunity to modify a Translate translation form immediately before it is submitted
	form: The form being submitted

mw.translate.hooks.beforeSubmit: Provides an opportunity to modify a Translate translation form immediately after it is submitted
	form: The form that has just been submitted
