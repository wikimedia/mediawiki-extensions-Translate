This document describes how event hooks work in the Translate extension;
how to add hooks for an event; and how to run hooks for an event.

For a more comprehensive guide to hooks, navigate to your root MediaWiki
directory, and then find /docs/hooks.txt.

== Rationale ==

Hooks allow us to decouple optionally-run code from code that is run for
everyone. It allows MediaWiki hackers, third-party developers and local
administrators to define code that will be run at certain points in the mainline
code, and to modify the data run by that mainline code. Hooks can keep mainline
code simple, and make it easier to write extensions. Hooks are a principled
alternative to local patches.

== Writing hooks ==

=== PHP hooks ===
For a more guide to PHP hooks, navigate to your root MediaWiki
directory, and then find /docs/hooks.txt .

=== JavaScript hooks ===
JavaScript hooks for the Translate extension are a little different. To use them, declare a
dependency on ext.translate.hooks . Then, use

	mw.translateHooks.add( name, hookFunction );

where name is a string, but hookFunction is not (unlike in the case of PHP hooks)
but rather a function reference. Return values from JavaScript hooks are ignored.

== Events and parameters ==

This is a list of known events and parameters; please add to it if you're going
to add events to the Translate extension.
