This document describes how event hooks work in the Translate extension;
how to add hooks for an event; and how to run hooks for an event.

For a more comprehensive guide to hooks, navigate to your root MediaWiki
directory, and then find /docs/hooks.txt.

== Rationale ==

Hooks allow us to decouple optionally-run code from code that is run for
everyone. It allows MediaWiki hackers, third-party developers and local
administrators to define code that will be run at certain points in the mainline
code, and to modify the data run by that mainline code. Hooks can keep mainline
code simple, and make it easier to write extensions. Hooks are a principled
alternative to local patches.

== Writing hooks ==

=== PHP hooks ===
For a guide to PHP hooks, navigate to your root MediaWiki
directory, and then find docs/hooks.txt.

=== JavaScript hooks ===
JavaScript hooks for the Translate extension are a little different. To use
them, declare a dependency on ext.translate.hooks:

 $wgResourceModules['...'] = array(
 	'scripts' => '...js',
 	'dependencies' => array( 'ext.translate.hooks' ),
 );

And then in that module use:
 mw.translateHooks.add( name, hookFunction );

where name is a string, but hookFunction is not (unlike in the case of PHP hooks)
but rather a function reference. Return values from JavaScript hooks are ignored.

== Events and parameters ==

This is a list of known events and parameters; please add to it if you're going
to add events to the Translate extension.

 array           $options: Active options

;TranslateBeforeAddModules: Provides an opportunity to load extra modules
 array          &$modules: List of resource loader module names

;TranslateFormatMessageBeforeTable: Provides an opportunity to manipulate the display of translation strings (messages) in the main table
 string         &$message: The message that will be displayed

 MessageGroup    $group: The source message group
 string          $targetLanguage: The language for which translations are being shown
 array          &$extraAttribs: An array of attributes that will be added to the table row

;TranslateGetBoxes: Provides an opportunity to add or remove "boxes" (translation helpers) from the translation interface
 MessageGroup    $group: The message group being worked on
 MessageHandle   $handle: An object representing the translation page (e.g. 'MediaWiki:Example/qqq')
 array          &$boxes: An associative array to be appended to (format: 'name' => 'some HTML string')

;TranslateGetExtraInputs: Provides an opportunity to add extra form inputs to to the default translation editor
 string         &$translation: The translation as it stands

;TranslateGetSpecialTranslateOptions: Provides an opportunity for overriding task values
 array          &$defaults: Associative array of default values
 array          &$nondefaults: Associative array of nondefault (override) values

;TranslatePrefillTranslation: Provides an opportunity for a new translation to start not from as a carte blanche (the default) but from some prefilled string
 string         &$translation: The translation string as it stands
 MessageHandle   $handle: The current MessageHandle object

=== JavaScript events ===
;afterRegisterFeatures: Provides an opportunity to register event handlers, etc., whenever a new form is opened.
