      "message": "Where does the global cache get updated for the CLI process? From the commit message, it seems to me that, with APC as the cache store, since it\u0027s not shared in web and CLI, it gets two different values. However, you worked around that by changing the config so it doesn\u0027t actually fix the problem. I believe we should be taking that also into account to properly support APC-configured users.",
