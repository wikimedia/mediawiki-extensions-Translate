So we have to find something that fits all. Group is generic, but harder to understand, I agree.\n\nHowever, we will be needed a pretty generic container word for this.",

      "message": "Agreed. If the container concept is \"group\" and it can have aggregates that are also called \"group\", then the sub item should be called a \"subgroup\".\n\nOr as Wikipedia describes it: In group theory, given a group G under a binary operation *, a subset H of G is called a subgroup of G if H also forms a group under the operation *.",
