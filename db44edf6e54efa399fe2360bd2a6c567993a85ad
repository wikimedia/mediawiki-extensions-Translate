      "message": "BoolAnd filters are executed in sequence per document.  Bool filters with multiple must clauses are executed by converting each filter into a bit field then anding them together.  The latter is normally faster if either of the sub-filters are reused.  May not make a difference in this context but normally Bool is preferred.  Not sure why I didn\u0027t notice this before.",
