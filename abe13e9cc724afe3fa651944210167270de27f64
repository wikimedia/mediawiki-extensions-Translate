      "message": "Did you consider using method_exists instead of is_callable?\n\nIt has perhaps a little bit cleaner syntax.\n\nYou are also using short array syntax here, but not elsewhere with the additions. Not a problem, but I\u0027d rather convert whole extension at once when the code review backlog is done.",

      "message": "I usually use is_callable() when I\u0027m making BC checks, since the semantics are a bit more straightforward.\n\nI tried to follow the style of the existing extension whether to use short or long syntax when making all these patches. In this case, it looks like one instance of short syntax slipped through code review at some point in ./specials/SpecialSearchTranslations.php. The mixed syntax in my changes comes from pasting the \"is_callable\" line, while copying the existing dieUsage() and using a search-and-replace to change it.",
