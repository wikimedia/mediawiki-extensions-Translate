What you want is to change the live value in the rendered page, use properties for that.\n\nThis currently works due to the jQuery Migrate layer, but this buggy incorrect behaviour has been deprecated and will no longer work in the future when we remove jQuery Migrate, at which point attribute and properties no longer overlap.",
