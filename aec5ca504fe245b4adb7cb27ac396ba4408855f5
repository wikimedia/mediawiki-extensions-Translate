Without checking carefully I then made the assumption that the string literal was being used throughout the code. Mentioned it here because I wanted to discuss that with you.\n\nAfter your review, checked again and found the constant - `wgTranslateDocumentationLanguageCode`\n\nI\u0027ve gotten rid of the method, since the primary reason I wrote it was to avoid having to hard-code `qqq` through out the client code.",
