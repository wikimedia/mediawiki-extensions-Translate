      "message": "Decided to wrap the functionality related to WANObjectCache in this class, and inject it into the Loaders / Stores. That way during tests these can be mocked.\n\nThe class itself is generic across loaders / stores, but is configured uniquely by each loader / group. Hence the need to checkConfig before in every public method.\n\nAnother gotcha is that it can handle only a single key per message group, which I think is fine.",
