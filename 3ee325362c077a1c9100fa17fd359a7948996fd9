      "message": "Small detail, but primitives should be type-documented with a lowercase character. An uppercase S would indicate that you expect a String object (new String(..)), which behaves differently than a regular string and may very well not be interchangeable. Similar to the way we denote primitive types in our PHP code docs (\"string, int, bool\" - except that int\u003enumber, bool\u003eboolean). \n\nSame for {Boolean} below.\n\nI\u0027ve added this to the code conventions for future reference. The ambiguity may be uncommon, but it does happen. Best to be explicit.",
